# Xss
Xss.sh is a simple bash script designed to identify potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities on a target website by injecting various XSS payloads into URL parameters and form inputs. It checks for reflected XSS vulnerabilities and reports potential issues based on payload reflections in the server's response.
